  <p class="title">Fantastic show alert - Fleabag</p>

                  It is already February, and in honor of this very special month we would like to share with you a very special show:
                  Fleabag. Based in the outskirts of London, the series follows a woman in her early thirties navigating a life that’s falling
                  apart. The series is short and sweet: only 2 seasons and 6 episodes each. And once the story has been told, it simply ends.
                  Sounds great right? You may have heard of its lead actress and author, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, from Killing Eve or the latest
                  Indiana Jones movie. She’s the new hot thing in the anglo-saxon entertainment industry, and this is undoubtedly due to
                  the success of this show.
              </p>

              <p class="article_summary">
                  The series is an adaptation of Waller-Bridge’s 2013 one-woman play of the same name. It fully focuses on her perspective which
                  is a rare take. But thankfully there’s a lot going on inside her head so it’s hard to get bored. At the start, you may find it hard
                  to warm up to the characters who are somehow all deeply unlikeable. Fleabag’s father is emotionally unavailable and avoids all forms
    of conflict, especially when it comes to defending her.
              </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
     Her step-mother is a snobby, hypocritical artist, who shamelessly tries to replace
    and erase her dead mother. Her sister is married to a detestable alcoholic but she refuses to leave from the fear of failing at something.
    The list goes but you get the gist of it. And then the cherry on top of the cake is our main character: Fleabag; a selfish, self-destructive,
    compulsive liar. In every possible way she seems completely unfit for living in a society.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Fleabag’s life is as chaotic as it gets. She runs a small hamster themed café that she opened with her now dead best friend Boo that receives
    around 1 customer per day. She is dating men who repulse her, yet they are usually the ones to leave. Her boyfriend repeatedly breaks up with
    because of her habit of masturbating to Barack Obama’s speeches. The woman is spiraling, but for some reason, she always comes out on top. Whenever she
    loses control of a situation, she looks straight at us and says something witty, self-deprecating, funny. She is aware of how ridiculous her life is and
    this is what gives us the illusion that she’s in control. By breaking the fourth wall, she draws us further into her thoughts, it feels like we’re
    always in on the joke and know all her secrets.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    But under this mask of apathy and witty cynicism, she is clearly in pain. She’s lost her mother to illness, and her best friend to an “accidental suicide”
    which she feels responsible for. In a flashback of Fleabag and Boo talking after her mother’s death she says: “I don’t know what to do with it, with all
    the love I have for her”. Her family, though they seem to be trying to help her (at least financially by offering money to keep her business afloat), invalidate
    her feelings and refuse to believe her when she is telling the truth. She is riddled with guilt and trying everything under the sun to distract herself.
    Her loneliness pushes her to confide in us, until she meets someone who really listens…
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    This is what makes this show great: the ridiculous mundane mixes with the visceral pain of loss. It’s both funny and profound. And though your life
    may not be as disastrous as hers (unless opening a hamster themed café has always been a dream of yours!), I can guarantee that you will relate to her.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    So if there is one takeaway from this article, it is that in the marathon of life, it gets busy and we may lose track of what truly matters.
    But we must keep the people we call family close by and focus on the things that make us happy or give us a purpose.
  </p>

    Until next time,
