                  In today's globalized world, where many of us come from different cultures and experience living in
                  multiple countries, questioning one’s sense of belonging isn’t so rare. It is a feeling difficult to navigate,
                  but our trusty novels are once again here for us, helping us find the words to articulate this bizarre world. In this article,
                  we will focus on two novels that really hit home for us: <i><b>10 Minutes 38 Seconds in this Strange World</b></i> by Elif Shafak,
                  and <i><b>Americanah</b></i> by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.
              </p>
              <p class="subtitle_aligned">10 Minutes 38 Seconds in this Strange World</p>
              <p class="article_summary">
                  “No one can survive alone – except the Almighty God. And remember, in the desert of life, the fool
                  travels alone and the wise by caravan.”

  <p class="paragraph">
      Belonging is simply defined as the act of being a part of or a member, yet it is a feeling people feel lucky to find. To fit in somewhere
      without all the masks and walls we oh so easily put up can feel freeing. The saying “blood is thicker than water” comes to mind, so does this
      mean we truly feel this sense of belonging only with the people we call family?
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
      This notion is questioned in <i>10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World</i>, which is the story of Tequila Leila, a pretty sexy name I must admit,
      who lays dying in a rubbish bin in Istanbul. Don’t worry this is not a spoiler! The book can be divided into the two parts, the first
      reveals Leila’s final, fondest memories before she loses consciousness, and the second is about what happens after her death. The storytelling is very
      interesting, it is almost like we are reading the main character’s life backwards but it still manages to keep the reader hooked.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
      We start off with a taste of Leila’s complicated childhood. Amongst an oppressive, religious father, an uncle that sexually abuses her, and two
      mothers it is safe to say that she feels confined by her family and their traditional outlook. Thus, she flees to Istanbul, the glitzy, deceiving city that
      exposes her to the harsh realities of life as a prostitute in a brothel.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
      Through Shafak’s mesmerizing, descriptive storytelling we get to know Leila’s surroundings from the smell of goat meat from her childhood home, to the
      cardamom coffee and evening breeze in Istanbul. To her, the city is "where all the discontented and all the dreamers eventually ended up". With time,
      she finds friends and they form a group of 5 individuals: Hollywood Humeyra, Jameelah, Nostalgia Nalan, Sabotage Sinan and Zaynab122. Each of them have their own story but a
      commonality between them is that they all are social outcasts in the traditional society they live in. These friends become Leila’s lifeline, they become the reliable
      constants she never had in life. Contrary to the family that ostracized her upon hearing she became a prostitute, her friends saw her for who she is beyond the societal labels.
      Shafak characterizes her friends as Leila’s “safety net” and during the harder times “they would gently pull her up and breathe life into her lungs”. In a city filled with an air
      of betrayal, loss, and mistreatment that is easy to get congested in, Leila’s friends filled her with hope and warmth in which she sought refuge in helping her rise up against
      the walls of patriarchy.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
      Leila belonged to her friends, those who celebrated her during her life, and remembered her after she died. They carried on with them Leila’s nature and treasured the
      times they spent together. Belonging as presented in 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World was found between strangers that stumbled upon each other but were destined to be an
      integral part of each of their lives.

  <p class="subtitle">Americanah</p>

  <p class="paragraph">
      An Americanah is an African person who immigrated to the US and as a consequence has erased their black identity in order to assimilate. In this story, Ifemulu leaves her Nigerian
      home in hopes of a better future in the land of the free (or are they really?), and slowly, she becomes one too.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
      This novel explores the theme of belonging with two interlaced POVs, Ifemulu's and her highschool sweetheart Obinze's. As the years go on, the two characters' lives could not
      have been more different, but they are inextricably tied by a single common thread, their shared upbringing in Nigeria and the time they had together.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
      Growing up in Nigeria, Ifemulu stands out for her outspoken opposition to the culture of corruption, nepotism and gold-digging. So when she is granted the opportunity to study in the US,
      the choice is easy to make. However, upon her arrival, she is confronted with a reality she had never given much thought to before: she is a black woman in a white country. And so begins
      several years of battling with her new identity, from her desperate attempts to assimilate, to proudly flaunting her differences. Gradually, she fights back and finds her voice, she is no
      longer concerned with maintaining a western appropriate hairstyle, reverts to her Nigerian accent, and most notably, she starts a blog (great minds think alike!). This blog is Adichie's way
      to express Ifemulu’s most unfiltered opinions on, you guessed it, race and identity. In it, she exposes the hypocrisy of the American racial discourse: "The only reason you say that race
      was not an issue is because you wish it was not. We all wish it was not. But it’s a lie. I came from a country where race was not an issue; I did not think of myself as black and I only
      became black when I came to America."
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
      Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic ocean, Obinze's experience isn’t so glamorous. Whilst Ifemulu is ascending the ladders of American "meritocracy", he is living in constant fear
      of deportation as an undocumented immigrant in London, stripped of all dignity and working illegally. But thankfully, he seems to really love the city: "London was a city of ghosts, some of
      them living, some of them dead, but all of them floating insubstantially through the white streets."
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
     Despite all the hardships they encounter, returning to their home country isn’t as easy as it seems. For Obinze, that would be admitting to his failure to succeed in the North. As for Ifemulu,
      it may be the apprehension of what she would be coming back to, a country, a community, that had moved on without her. She would once again be a stranger, this time amongst her own people.
      Is there a way out of this vicious cycle, condemning them to always feel like outcasts?
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
      This story presents the idea that perhaps the feeling of belonging comes from an environment that allows one to be their truest self and feel loved. As Adichie wrote, "Home was not just
      the place where you lived. It was the place where you became yourself, where you could be more than yourself. It was, for lack of a better word, your life."
  </p>

  <p class="subtitle">Conclusion...finally</p>

  <p class="paragraph">
      Phew, that was heavy! To conclude this emotional journey, we hope that this article did justice to these masterpieces and perhaps offered our dearest readers a new way of understanding them.
      If, however, you haven’t had the chance to read one or either, what are you waiting for?
