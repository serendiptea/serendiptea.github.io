  <p class="title">Cracey: a guide</p>
  <p class="paragraph">01/10/2023</p>

  <p class="paragraph">
      Cracey, the backbone of our philosophy, the founding principle of our blog.
      In this article, we will attempt to explain, and dare I say convince, you, our dear readers, to adopt the
      cracey mentality.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
      First, let's trace the origins of cracey. It all begins with none other than Cracey Man, a social media superstar who charms
      thousands of viewers with his bald head and inspirational videos. With his captivating lisp, he promotes self-love and spontaneity.
  </p>

  <p class="subtitle">But what is cracey?</p>
  <p class="paragraph">
      Cracey is all about acting upon the harmless impulses you have throughout the day that society has brainwashed into considering them strange.
      It is about embrassing the small joys of life, and having fun in everything we do. For me, this is running from a to b, just because, matching
      outfits with unwilling participants, or starting a blog. For you, it may be incorporating parkour into your daily commute, or skipping that boring
      meeting on a Friday afternoon to go to a pottery class. Whatever it may be, we all have a chance to be cracey, and must seize it.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
      At the end of the day, we are all just little bits of flesh, on a big spinning rock, and all that really matters is whether you had a good giggle today.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
      Think of it this way: in ten years time, will you remember your 9 am thermodynamics class, or will you remember that day you pretended to study
      German to taste some delicious free mulled wine?
  </p>


  <p class="final_paragraph">
    Now it's your turn to go out, be brave, and just be cracey.
