  <p class="title">Climbing the mountain of life</p>
  <p class="paragraph">01/12/2023</p>

  <p class="paragraph">
      Dear readers,
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
      Brace yourself, we are delving deep with this article. It all started when we
      read the quote “what is the point of climbing a mountain if you can’t share the view with someone?”.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Whilst there may be many interpretations of this quote, the one that we latched onto was how it relates to in
    this world that conditions us to always keep hustling and get that ‘next big thing’. From getting ‘that’ job or promotion,
    to then getting ‘that’ house, the rat race goes on. Dare we say we live in a world where we need to constantly prove to ourselves
    and those around us our importance with these materialistic prizes or tags. Our society glamorizes working 24x7 at the expense
    of our loved ones. And at the end of it all, when we achieve all of our fancy schmancy gizmos will we have anyone around us to
    share them with? If we don't, is it even worth it? We imagine that these tangible things around us of monetary value will
    provide us happiness but this may not be all that true.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Don’t get me wrong, we aren’t saying we live a life without ambitions or responsibilities…though it may sound nice to a few
    of us. But for all that we do in the fast world we live in, does it make us happy? But then what is the key to happiness?
    These aren’t questions that can be easily answered, but here’s some golden nuggets from one of the world’s longest studies on
    happiness.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
      This Harvard study began in 1938 during the Great Depression and the aim of the longitudinal study was to break down what
    leads to healthy and happy lifes. What makes this study unique is that along with the physical data that was collected, data
    on the lives of these people throughout their lifetime was collected. This allowed researchers to make connections with life
    experiences, their health and wellbeing. Since the beginning of the study, it has been now expanded to include the original
    participants’ offspring as well. The most important finding of this study has been that an aspect that can have a powerful
    influence on our health are our relationships and how happy we are in these. More than money, or fame, close relationships are
    what keeps people happy. The study’s director Robert Waldinger said in his TED talk, “the people who were the most satisfied in
    their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80.” and we couldn’t have said it any better!
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    So if there is one takeaway from this article, it is that in the marathon of life, it gets busy and we may lose track of what truly matters.
    But we must keep the people we call family close by and focus on the things that make us happy or give us a purpose.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    This article comes just in time during the holiday season! So if you plan to spend time with close ones, we hope this article reminds you to
    hug them a little tighter, spend quality time and enjoy their company with plenty of wine and food preferably!
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    We would also like to take a moment to thank our lovely readers and a sign off on 2023, keep an eye out for the exciting things
    coming to this space in 2024.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Happy holidays and happy new year,
  </p>
